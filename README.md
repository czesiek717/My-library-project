# My-library-project
This was my first serious spring&hibernate application

This application was made using spring boot, spring security, hibernate, hibernate search and lucenes search engine. 
After making some off guides projects I decided to make something on my own to practice what I've learned. 
This is still work in progress and everything, but it has the general functionality.

The HTML pages are very poor, but I was more focused on the application itself than the looks of it. 
Maybe I will update them at some point.

At some point I would also like to create aspect logging for this project.
